A stack buffer overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() can occur when the bits parameter is larger than the largest supported curve. In some configurations with PSA disabled, all values of bits are affected. (This never happens in internal library calls, but can affect applications that call these functions directly.)",

With TLS 1.3, when a server enables optional authentication of the client, if the client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values in if keyUsage or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE bits clear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other than TLS client authentication would nonetheless be able to use it for TLS client authentication. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with optional authentication (with required authentication, the handshake would be aborted with a fatal alert).",

Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass verification.",

Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes.
